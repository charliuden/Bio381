# 1.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2) # for graphics
library(MASS) # for maximum likelihood estimation

#read in data vector:

# quick and dirty, a truncated normal distribution to work on the solution set

z <- rnorm(n=3000,mean=0.2)
z <- data.frame(1:3000,z)
names(z) <- list("ID","myVar")
z <- z[z$myVar>0,] #make values positive
str(z)
summary(z$myVar)

```

###Plot Histogram
Plot a histogram of the data, using a modification of the code from lecture. Here we are switching from qplot to ggplot for more graphics options. We are also rescaling the y axis of the histogram from counts to density, so that the area under the histogram equals 1.0.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
p1 <- ggplot(data=z, aes(x=myVar, y=..density..)) +
  geom_histogram(color="grey60",fill="cornsilk",size=0.2) 
print(p1)
```

###Add empirical density curve
Now modify the code to add in a kernel density plot of the data. This is an empirical curve that is fitted to the data. It does not assume any particular probability distribution, but it smooths out the shape of the histogram:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
p1 <-  p1 +  geom_density(linetype="dotted",size=0.75)
print(p1)
```


###Get a maximum lilihood parameter for normal
Next, fit a normal distribution to your data and grab the maximum likelihood estimators of the two parameters of the normal, the mean and the variance:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
normPars <- fitdistr(z$myVar,"normal")
print(normPars)
str(normPars)
normPars$estimate["mean"] # note structure of getting a named attribute
```

###Plot normal probability density
Now let’s call the dnorm function inside ggplot’s stat_function to generate the probability density for the normal distribution. Read about  stat_function in the help system to see how you can use this to add a smooth function to any ggplot. Note that we first get the maximum likelihood parameters for a normal distribution fitted to thse data by calling fitdistr. Then we pass those parameters (meanML and sdML to  stat_function:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
meanML <- normPars$estimate["mean"]
sdML <- normPars$estimate["sd"]

xval <- seq(0,max(z$myVar),len=length(z$myVar))

 stat <- stat_function(aes(x = xval, y = ..y..), fun = dnorm, colour="red", n = length(z$myVar), args = list(mean = meanML, sd = sdML))
 p1 + stat
```
 
Notice that the best-fitting normal distribution (red curve) for these data actually has a biased mean. That is because the data set has no negative values, so the normal distribution (which is symmetric) is not working well.

###Plot exponential probability density
Now let’s use the same template and add in the curve for the exponential: 
 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
 expoPars <- fitdistr(z$myVar,"exponential")
rateML <- expoPars$estimate["rate"]

stat2 <- stat_function(aes(x = xval, y = ..y..), fun = dexp, colour="blue", n = length(z$myVar), args = list(rate=rateML))
 p1 + stat + stat2
```


###Plot uniform probability density
For the uniform, we don’t need to use fitdistr because the maximum likelihood estimators of the two parameters are just the minimum and the maximum of the data:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
stat3 <- stat_function(aes(x = xval, y = ..y..), fun = dunif, colour="darkgreen", n = length(z$myVar), args = list(min=min(z$myVar), max=max(z$myVar)))
 p1 + stat + stat2 + stat3
```

###Plot gamma probability density

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
gammaPars <- fitdistr(z$myVar,"gamma")
shapeML <- gammaPars$estimate["shape"]
rateML <- gammaPars$estimate["rate"]

stat4 <- stat_function(aes(x = xval, y = ..y..), fun = dgamma, colour="brown", n = length(z$myVar), args = list(shape=shapeML, rate=rateML))
 p1 + stat + stat2 + stat3 + stat4
```
 
###Plot beta probability density
This one has to be shown in its own plot because the raw data must be rescaled so they are between 0 and 1, and then they can be compared to the beta.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
pSpecial <- ggplot(data=z, aes(x=myVar/(max(myVar + 0.1)), y=..density..)) +
  geom_histogram(color="grey60",fill="cornsilk",size=0.2) + 
  xlim(c(0,1)) +
  geom_density(size=0.75,linetype="dotted")

betaPars <- fitdistr(x=z$myVar/max(z$myVar + 0.1),start=list(shape1=1,shape2=2),"beta")
shape1ML <- betaPars$estimate["shape1"]
shape2ML <- betaPars$estimate["shape2"]

statSpecial <- stat_function(aes(x = xval, y = ..y..), fun = dbeta, colour="orchid", n = length(z$myVar), args = list(shape1=shape1ML,shape2=shape2ML))
pSpecial + statSpecial
```
  
  
# 2. My turn!

Once the code is in and runs, try reading in your own .csv file into a data frame with this code chunk:

z <- read.table("MyDataFile.csv",header=TRUE,sep=",", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
str(z)
summary(z)

###Plot a Histogram:

This data set conatins various brac measurements on the centaurea seed head. For today's exercise, I am going to look at the variable "Brac_Len", or brac length.  

```{r, echo=TRUE}
#To find location of file:
#> file.choose()
#[1] "/Users/charlotteuden/Desktop/First_Term/INV_ECO/invasion_ecology/CentaureaCapitulatData.csv"

z <- read.csv("/Users/charlotteuden/Desktop/First_Term/INV_ECO/invasion_ecology/CentaureaCapitulatData.csv", sep=",", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE) 
head(z)

p1 <- ggplot(data=z, aes(x=Brac_Len, y=..density..)) +
  geom_histogram(color="grey60",fill="cornsilk",size=0.2) 
print(p1)
# Brac length distribution looks pretty normal.   
```

###Add empirical density curve

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
p1 <-  p1 +  geom_density(linetype="dotted",size=0.75) #"smooths out data" 
print(p1)
```


###Get a maximum lilihood parameter for normal
Next, fit a normal distribution to your data and grab the maximum likelihood estimators of the two parameters of the normal, the mean and the variance:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
normPars <- fitdistr(z$Brac_Len,"normal") 
print(normPars)
str(normPars)
normPars$estimate["mean"] # note structure of getting a named attribute
```

###Plot normal probability density

meanML <- normPars$estimate["mean"]
sdML <- normPars$estimate["sd"]

xval <- seq(0,max(z$uptake),len=length(z$uptake))

 stat <- stat_function(aes(x = xval, y = ..y..), fun = dnorm, colour="red", n = length(z$myVar), args = list(mean = meanML, sd = sdML))
 p1 + stat
```
 

###Plot exponential probability density
Now let’s use the same template and add in the curve for the exponential: 
 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
 expoPars <- fitdistr(z$uptake,"exponential")
rateML <- expoPars$estimate["rate"]

stat2 <- stat_function(aes(x = xval, y = ..y..), fun = dexp, colour="blue", n = length(z$uptake), args = list(rate=rateML))
 p1 + stat + stat2
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
stat3 <- stat_function(aes(x = xval, y = ..y..), fun = dunif, colour="darkgreen", n = length(z$uptake), args = list(min=min(z$uptake), max=max(z$uptake)))
 p1 + stat + stat2 + stat3
```

###Plot gamma probability density

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
gammaPars <- fitdistr(z$uptake,"gamma")
shapeML <- gammaPars$estimate["shape"]
rateML <- gammaPars$estimate["rate"]

stat4 <- stat_function(aes(x = xval, y = ..y..), fun = dgamma, colour="brown", n = length(z$uptake), args = list(shape=shapeML, rate=rateML))
 p1 + stat + stat2 + stat3 + stat4
```
 
###Plot beta probability density
This one has to be shown in its own plot because the raw data must be rescaled so they are between 0 and 1, and then they can be compared to the beta.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
pSpecial <- ggplot(data=z, aes(x=uptake/(max(uptake + 0.1)), y=..density..)) +
  geom_histogram(color="grey60",fill="cornsilk",size=0.2) + 
  xlim(c(0,1)) +
  geom_density(size=0.75,linetype="dotted")

betaPars <- fitdistr(x=z$uptake/max(z$uptake + 0.1),start=list(shape1=1,shape2=2),"beta")
shape1ML <- betaPars$estimate["shape1"]
shape2ML <- betaPars$estimate["shape2"]

statSpecial <- stat_function(aes(x = xval, y = ..y..), fun = dbeta, colour="orchid", n = length(z$uptake), args = list(shape1=shape1ML,shape2=shape2ML))
pSpecial + statSpecial
```

# 3. 
Take a look at the second-to-last graph which shows the histogram of your data and 4 probability density curves (normal, uniform, exponential, gamma) that are fit to the data. The beta distribution in the final graph is somewhat special. It often fits the data pretty well, but that is because we have assumed the largest data point is the true upper bound, and everything is scaled to that. The fit of the uniform distribution also fixes the upper bound. The other curves (normal, exponential, and gamma) are more realistic because they do not have an upper bound. For most data sets, the gamma will probably fit best, but if you data set is small, it may be very hard to see much of a difference between the curves.


# 4. 
Using the best-fitting distribution, go back to the code and get the maximum likelihood parameters. Use those to simulate a new data set, with the same length as your original vector, and plot that in a histogram and add the probability density curve. Right below that, generate a fresh histogram plot of the original data, and also include the probability density curve.


#Homework #6

###Long and wide data formats:

Try converting the iris data set into the long format, with a column called “trait” to indicate sepal and petal length and width.

Once you have converted to the long format, calculate the average for each combination of species and trait.

```{r,echo=TRUE}
library(tidyr)
head(iris)

irisLong <- iris %>%
  gather(Sepal.Length:Petal.Width, key="trait", value="response") 
           
irisData <- irisLong %>%
  group_by(trait, Species) %>%
  summarize(mean=mean(response)) %>%
  arrange(Species, trait)

print(irisData)
```
