## Presentation Goals

The primary goal of this presentation is to learn how to make a presentation in \ LaTex. I have chosen the life history of Centaurea as my subject becasue I will be working with this species during the coming term. 

Questions: Will understanding the species' life history help us tackle its invasion? What stage of the Centaurea (an invasive plant species) life cycle is most vulnerable to biological control?  


## Stages in the Life Cycle of Centaurea

- \color{green} seed
-  jeuvenile
-  vegetative
-  flowering

## Data Collection:

>- number that graduated to next life cycle
>- number that stayed in same stage of life cycle
>- number that reverted back to previous stayce
>- number that died

>- From this data, transitions from stage to stage will be calculated.
