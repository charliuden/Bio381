## Presentation Goals

The primary goal of this presentation is to learn how to make a presentation in \ LaTex. I have chosen the life history of \textit{Centaurea} as my subject becasue I will be working with this species during the coming term. \textit{Centaurea} is a genus of flowering plants introduced from Europe. In its introduced range (North America), it has become a successful competitor. 

Questions: Will understanding \textit{Centaurea's} life history help us prevent contued spread of the species? What stage of the \textit{Centaurea} life cycle is most vulnerable to biological control?  


## Stages in the Life Cycle of \textit{Centaurea}

- \color{green} seed
-  jeuvenile
-  vegetative
-  flowering

## Data Collection:

>- number that transition to next life stage
>- number that stayed in same stage 
>- number that reverted back to previous stage
>- number that died

>- From this data, transitions from stage to stage will be calculated.
