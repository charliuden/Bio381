# simple inequalities
5>3
5<3
5<=5
5==3
5!=3 #! means NOT

# use & for AND (make evaluations for things on both sides)
5>3&1!=2
1=2&1!=2 #in order for & to return true, both sides must be true

# | for OR 
1==2|1!=2

# this works with vectors
1:5>3

a <- 1:10
b <- 10:1
a>4
b>4
a>4&b>4

#use "long from" of & and | to evaluate only the first element
a>4 && b>4

# also || for long form for OR
a<4|b>4
a<4||b>4
a[1]<4|b[1]>4 #identical statment to the one before

#xor for exclusive OR testing "exclusive or"
#work for (TRUE FLASE) but not (TRUE TRUE)
a <- c(0,0,1)
b <- c(0,1,1)
a|b
xor(a,b)

# Set operators

#boolean algebra on sets of atomic vectors (logical, numeric, character strings)

"three" < "five" #these are character strings, not numbers. R will alphabetise character strings
FALSE<TRUE #r conversts boulean operators into 1 or 0

a <- 1:7
b <- 5:10

# union function to get all elements
union(a,b) #gives you elements that are common between two vectors adn makes on vector

# intersect to common elements
intersect(a,b) #fives number found in both

# setdiff to get distinct elemnts in a or b (depending on which you put first)
setdiff(a,b)
setdiff(b,a)

# setequal to check for identical elements
setequal(a,b)

# equality comares elemtn by element
z <- matrix(1:12, nrow=4, byrow=TRUE)
z
z1 <- matrix(1:12, nrow=4, byrow=FALSE) #fill by column is default setting in R
z1
z==z1
#use identical for entire structure comman
identical(z,z1) #FALSE because elements are not same
z1 <-z
identical(z,z1) #now we have made z1 and z the same, so they are identical

# use %in% function to check for a subset
d <- 12
d %in% union(a,b) # "is d in the union of a and b? false, because union of a and b dont contain 12
is.element(d,union(a,b)) # same thing out 

d <- c(10,12)
d %in% union(a,b)
d %in% a


#----------WANT TO USE THESE COMMANDS TO CONTROL FLOW OF OUR CODE. -------------

# Condition if statements

#be careful with if statemnts, whic hrequire a sincla logical value

#this deosnt do anything

#also not so good:
if(z<7)print(z)
  
#use subsetting!
